I currently work as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Communications and New Media](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/cnm/) at [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/). Previously, I have taught and conducted research at School of Journalism and Communication, Nanjing University, my alma mater, where I gained valuable experience in curriculum design, research management, as well as mentoring undergraduate and graduate students.

I received my Ph.D. in Communication in 2022 from the [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) (CityU), where I was intellectually nurtured within the [Web Mining Laboratory](http://weblab.com.cityu.edu.hk/blog/), founded and coordinated by the esteemed Chair Professor of Computational Social Science and ICA Fellow [Prof. Jonathan J. H. Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q41vFFQAAAAJ&hl=en) at the [Department of Media and Communication](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/com). A Computational Social Scientist in Communication by training, my work sits at the intersection of **digital media**, **online safety**, and **cultural analytics**, with the overarching goal of advancing **digital resilience** — the capacity of individuals, communities, and institutions to navigate, withstand, and adapt to the risks and disruptions of digitally mediated environments. I specialize in text-as-data methods, computational modeling, and large-scale digital datasets to study how harmful information ecosystems emerge and how cultural forces shape collective responses to them.

My research has appeared in top communication and interdisciplinary journals such as *New Media & Society*, *EPJ Data Science*, *Humanities and Social Sciences Communications*, *American Psychologist*, *Journal of Information Technology & Politics*, *Chinese Journal of Communication*, *Journal of Social Issues*, *International Journal of Business Communication*, *Communications: The European Journal of Communication Research*, *Sage Open*, and *Communication and the Public*. By integrating computational methods with communication theory, I aim to generate actionable insights into the forces that threaten — and the conditions that strengthen — resilience in digital societies.
