## Research Overview
My research is organized around three interconnected pillars: **digital media**, **online safety**, and **cultural analytics**, united by a commitment to understanding and strengthening **digital resilience**. I examine how digital infrastructures, from anonymous networks to mainstream social platforms, generate risks to information integrity, civic discourse, and cultural stability, and how individuals and societies develop the capacity to respond to those risks. Bridging computational social science and communication studies, I deploy text-as-data methods, social network analysis, and large-scale computational modeling to investigate the socio-technical conditions that either erode or reinforce resilience in digitally mediated societies. My work aspires to move beyond diagnosis toward generative insight: identifying not only where digital environments fail, but what makes communities and cultures more robust in the face of those failures.

## Research Themes
### 1. Online Safety in Digital Media Ecosystems

A core strand of my research examines threats to online safety across digital media ecosystems, including anonymous networks, fringe platforms, and the Dark Web, and the mechanisms by which harmful information spreads. Leveraging natural language processing, social network analysis, and LLM-based modeling, I map how misinformation, conspiracy narratives, and illicit communities operate and sustain themselves online. My analyses of Tor-based Dark Web cryptomarket forums reveal how linguistic diversity, community norms, and user engagement jointly structure spaces that resist conventional oversight (see Chen, Meng & Wang, 2023; Chen & Liu, 2025). I also situate the Tor network itself as a dual-use infrastructure: while anonymity tools empower vulnerable individuals to access information and express dissent, they simultaneously lower barriers for harmful actors. Tracing the knowledge accumulation processes and global adoption patterns behind such technologies (see Chen et al., 2024) is therefore essential for designing interventions that protect legitimate users while curbing abuse, a foundational concern for any resilience-oriented approach to internet governance. Extending this work to the Surface Web, my research on the COVID-19 infodemic traced how conspiracy theories propagated through right-wing media ecosystems and fused with geopolitical narratives to erode public trust (see Chen et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2024).

### 2. Cultural Analytics for Digital Resilience

My second research strand applies cultural analytics, such as the large-scale computational analysis of cultural texts and artifacts, to understand how societies develop and sustain resilience under conditions of rapid digital transformation and geopolitical pressure. Cultural resilience, in this framing, is not merely resistance to change but the adaptive capacity to preserve meaning, identity, and cohesion while navigating disruption. Using word embedding models applied to decades of printed texts, I have tracked the long-term trajectory of individualism in China, showing how digital modernity is quietly reshaping foundational cultural values (see Hamamura et al., 2021; 2022; 2025). These findings illuminate the cultural substrates on which digital resilience is built, and the fault lines along which it may fracture.

Complementing this, I examine how media and advertising discourse responds to geopolitical crises, tracing how multinational corporations recalibrate their cultural messaging under conditions of military conflict and international tension (see Sun et al., 2024). This work reveals how cultural orientations, such as individualism versus collectivism, are strategically activated or suppressed in response to external shocks, with direct implications for how institutions communicate in moments of crisis and how publics make sense of those communications. Across both lines of inquiry, cultural analytics emerges not as a merely descriptive exercise but as a diagnostic tool for identifying the communicative resources societies draw upon, or fail to draw upon, when their resilience is tested.
